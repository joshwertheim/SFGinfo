# SFGinfo
Source for SF Giants web application hosted on Google App Engine.

Currently built using Google's webapp2 framework and Python. Code is loosely based on my earlier [sandlotbot](https://github.com/joshwertheim/sandlotbot) project.

Still very much a work in progress. I'm planning to make it look a lot nicer. It'll also be much more functional than just a simple news reader.
